# cufflesss bloos pressure

The main goal of this project is to predict the systolic and diastolic blood pressure by means of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal instead of direct measurement of blood pressure with cuffed devices. 

the dataset in project was used from the following article:

A. Esmaili, M. Kachuee and M. Shabany, "Nonlinear Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation of Healthy Subjects Using Pulse Transit Time and Arrival Time," in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, vol. 66, no. 12, pp. 3299-3308, Dec. 2017, doi: 10.1109/TIM.2017.2745081.
